# Projecting Success of Kickstarter Projects

# About
This analysis is meant to compare machine learning models predicting Kickstarter projects funding successes and failures. This analysis includes three machine learning models: logistic regression, neural networks and gradient boosting. 

This analysis constitutes the second project submission of the FinTech Bootcamp curriculum by Trilogy Education Services. 

# Technologies
This analysis was made using Python (v3.7.0), WindowsOS, MacOS, Jupyter Lab, and Google Colaboratory. <br/>

This analysis uses the following libraries and dependencies:


# Data
This analysis reads data from one csv file. The data includes each Kickstarter Project's []

# Results
The gradient boosting model achieved the highest accuracy in both precision and recall scores.
